#+TITLE: Greetings, traveller. What brings you to these parts?

Please, take a seat and warm your frozen boots by the hearth. Would you like a
drink? A pair of warm socks? No? Well, if you must know about me... I'm a:

- 3rd year computer science student at Northeastern University
- Fledgling developer and open source dabbler
- Compulsive emacs tinkerer
- Lover and rider of bicycles
- Amateur guitarist and rock music listener
- (917) New Yorker

I could go on, but I know you there must be more important topics at hand. If
you've come to seek the [[google:foobar][projects]] I've worked on, or the [[google:baz][work experience]] I've
had, well, look no further. If you're only seeking shelter for the night, I
can point you on your way to [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-leba/][LinkedIn]] or [[https://github.com/ethan-leba][GitHub]].
