#+DESCRIPTION: Proving correctness of the stop-and-wait protocol

This was the final project of the class Logic and Computation I took during the
spring 2021 semester. In this project I proved the resilience of the
stop-and-wait protocol (most commonly used in bluebooth, a subset of TCP) to
network failures -- showing that the data will never be malformed.

The paper can be viewed [[file:media/writeup.pdf][here]], and the source code can be viewed on GitHub [[https://github.com/ethan-leba/stop-and-wait-arq-proof][here]].
